1. Call to Order: The meeting called to order with a warm welcome by the Hon‚Äôble President.

2. Presentation of the Current Financial Report: The Secretary presented an in-depth breakdown financial report shedding light on the association's current financial standing (FY 2024 ‚Äì 25) along with proposed budget for the FY 2025-26. This report highlighted key financial metrics, projected cost & revenue, and strategic allocations designed to drive organizational growth and stability. The Secretary also highlighted the association's consistent budget deficit over the past few years to the members, emphasizing the need for financial adjustments. In the ensuing formal discussion, the Secretary emphasized the critical need to establish a goal aimed at reducing the fiscal deficit through disciplined spending. The following measures were taken to ensure the financial sustainability of our operations:

o Enhancement of MMC: In the last AGM held on 14th July 2024, the provisionally accepted increase of ‚Çπ100 pertaining to MMC was re-assessed by the members in the light of the current financial situation and the proposed budget for the upcoming FY 2025 ‚Äì 26. Finally, an increment of ‚Çπ150 was unanimously agreed upon, effective 1st April 2025. This adjustment aims to better support the association's finances and narrow the income ‚Äì expenditure gap.

o Revision of Discount Structure for One-Time Payment of MMC: The current discount policy on one payment of MMC has become a significant burden for an ailing establishment like ours. Amid the ongoing financial crisis, this policy fails to provide any tangible benefits to our Association. After thorough discussions with the members, the following revised rates will be effective from 1st April 2025.

ÔÇß 6-Month Payments: The discount will be adjusted from the current 6% to 2%.
ÔÇß 1-Year Payments: The discount will be adjusted from the current 6% to 4%.
ÔÇß Members also expressed their intention to consider further reduction in the discount percentage of one-time payment from FY 2026 - 27 considering the association‚Äôs financial situation. This decision reflects a thoughtful and strategic response to the evolving economic landscape, aiming to create a more balanced and equitable financial framework for all members.

3. Facilitating Common Area Capital Expenditures: To facilitate the capital expenditures for common areas, such as the renovation of the STP, road repairs, erection of security room at back gate etc. as detailed in the report, the house thoroughly reviewed the requirement, and it was unanimously decided to collect ADHOC payments of ‚Çπ2000 for each flat in two (2) instalments during January and April 2025.

4. Embracing Opportunities Amid Financial Challenges: The residents expressed their concerns on the prevailing financial difficulties and the association‚Äôs inability to timely pay salaries, staff benefits and other financial dues. All members of the General Body assured their full support and cooperation for the smooth functioning of the Association.

5. Approvals of Agenda Items: All members expressed their willingness to approve the agenda items to facilitate the necessary implementation of the decisions.

6. Date of Next Meeting: The members unanimously agreed to hold the Executive Committee Meeting on 22nd February 2025.

Closing Remarks: The meeting concluded with a heartfelt vote of thanks to the chair, echoing the spirit of cooperation and community solidarity.
